# SeventeenMon

SeventeenMon simply help you find location by IP address. Data is totally based on [IPIP.NET](https://www.ipip.net/product/client.html).

Version >= 2.0 only support ipdb format.

## Compatibility

I have tested it on Ruby 2.1.10, 2.4.6, 2.6.2. Other versions are not tested but should work on well. Please contact me if not.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'seventeen_mon', git: "https://github.com/BlindingDark/SeventeenMon"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

This project is forked from [mycolorway/SeventeenMon](https://github.com/mycolorway/SeventeenMon).
Install by gem will be used the mycolorway's **old version**.

I am considering releasing a new gem package, but I didn't think of a good name. Please contact me if you have some good idea, thanks.
